Some HTML5 Canvas 2D experiments with manipulating photos on the fly by mouse movements. Not so useful now but pretty fun.

Run demo/index.html (needs to be running via HTTP server to prevent cross-domain policy violations) and move your mouse up/down or left/right. Left <---> right controls the granularity of the image (1px up to 16px) and up <--> down controls the padding in between the 'grains'. Will be adding more distortions in due course.
